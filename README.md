# Memory Souls

Memory Souls is a top-down Souls-like game made as a proof of concept. Memory Souls was originally made in MonoGame using Prime31's Nez framework, and was later ported to Unity over a few days. 

Fight a boss by walking up to it and entering the prompted button combo - it's always the same combo until you successfully complete one. Make sure to roll in order to dodge attacks!

## Controls
Controller recommended

- Move: WASD / Left Stick
- Roll: Spacebar / Right Trigger
- Attacks: Arrow keys / Face Buttons
- Quit: ESC

## How to Play
- Browser: https://kevinni73.github.io/MemorySouls/
    - note: the WebGL build can't detect input device changes, so it will always display Xbox controls
- Windows PC: Unzip "/Build/Memory Souls Windows Build.zip" and run "Memory Souls.exe"
